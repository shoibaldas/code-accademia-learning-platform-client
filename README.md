# Getting Started with Code Accademia

This project was bootstrapped with ReactJs, Tailwind component CSS, React router DOM, Context API. And for, server handling I have used Express Js and later hosted the API in Vercel server. Also, I have included Firbase Google Auth Provider, Github Auth Provider as Authentication services for user login along with general Sign in. Accessing through some routes is prohibited with Private Routes and can only access after authentication. In course route, all the data are dinamically displayed and fetched from API through Id. To scroll within the same page I have used react-scroll and to download pdf of details, I have used react-to-pdf
