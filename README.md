# Getting Started with Code Accademia

This project was bootstrapped with `ReactJs`, `Tailwind component CSS`, `React router DOM`, `Context API`. And for, server handling I have used `Express Js` and later hosted the API in `Vercel` server. Moreoverly,

1. ** I have included Firbase Google Auth Provider, Github Auth Provider as Authentication services for user login along with general Sign in.**
2. ** Accessing through some routes is prohibited with Private Routes and can only access after authentication.**
3. ** In course route, all the data are dinamically displayed and fetched from API through Id. **
4. ** To scroll within the same page I have used react-scroll and to download pdf of details, I have used react-to-pdf.**
5. ** User will get error if the login information doesn't match with authentication provider. **
6. ** Using Context API to send data to the children components without props, made this app more robust. **
